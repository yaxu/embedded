-- Start with a simple scale

let s = n (run 8) # sound "arpy"

-- listen to it

d1 $ s

-- what does it sound like on the weft? (with a silent warp)
-- you hear every other note, going back and forth

d1 $ tabby 8 silence s

-- how about the warp? (with a silent weft)
-- the warp is going up and down, but as we scan across the wefts we alternate between hearing the download
-- and upward movements. Unlike with the weft, we do eventually hear all the notes, though.
d1 $ tabby 8 s silence

-- how about with the same scale on both the warp and weft?
-- a nice folk tune!
d1 $ tabby 8 s s
  # room "0.3"

-- lets separate the warp and weft between left and right speakers
d1 $ tabby 8 (s # pan "0") (s # pan "1")
  # room "0.3"
